sie_get_py
==========

1) Put your SIE-Batch API key into ~/.sie-get-key.txt and make sure
   it isn't readable by others:

   chmod u=r,go-rwx ~/.sie-get-key.txt

2) You likely already have python3 (in fact, perhaps even multiple copies
   of python3). The script will use the version that it finds first in your
   path. However, you can reinstall a new copy should you desire to do so.
   For example, if you're on a Mac and use Homebrew to manage your packages,
   say:

   $ brew install python3

3) Install/update the separate modules we need:

   sudo pip3 install datetime
   sudo pip3 install pathlib
   sudo pip3 install pycurl

4) We assume that the host IP you're using to access SIE Batch has been
   explicitly whitelisted by Farsight.

   IF NOT, you'll need to enable proxy support in the client, then
   create an ssh tunnel to a bastion host that has access

   To enable proxy support in the client, note the line in the Python source:

	useproxy = False    # note: 'false' will not work

   Assuming the bastion host is called bastionhost.example.com :

        ssh -D 127.0.0.1:1080 bastionhost.example.com

5) Install the Python script to a directory in your path and make it
   executable:

   sudo cp sie_get_py.py /usr/local/bin/sie_get_py
   sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/si_get_py

6) Try the client (assuming you have access to ch212; update the specific
   dates to something from the last day or so)

   sie_get_py             <-- see usage summary
   sie_get_py checkkey    <-- verify key
   sie_get_py channels    <-- get list of channels
   sie_get_py 212         <-- details for a channel

   sie_get_py 212 now 5   <-- grab 5 minutes of ch212
   sie_get_py 212 "2020-01-28 19:17:00" "2020-01-28 19:22:00"

   Output will be to a file in your current directory. That filename
   will be something like the following:

   sie-ch212-{2020-01-18@21:22:19}-{2020-01-18@21:32:19}.jsonl

   Breaking that down and ignoring punctuation:

   sie                  Data source
   ch212                The channel from the source
   startdatetime        Starting datetime UTC
   enddatetime          Ending datetime UTC
   filetype             jsonl or nmsg depending on content
