1) Put your SIE-Batch API key into ~/.sie-get-key.txt and make sure
   it isn't readable by others:

   chmod u=r,go-rwx ~/.sie-get-key.txt

2) We assume that you have a working c development environment.

   We assume that the source for the client is in sie_get_clients/sie_get_c

   cd into that directory

   Review the Makefile and tweak any defaults you don't like. 

3) We assume that the host IP you're using to access SIE Batch has been
   explicitly whitelisted by Farsight.

   IF NOT, you'll need to enable proxy support in the client, then
   create an ssh tunnel to a bastion host that has access. To enable 
   proxy support in the client, note the line in sie_get_c.h:

	char useproxy[] = "no"; /* "yes" or "no" */

   When you're ready to use the client, be sure the tunnel to your bastion
   host has been created. Assuming the bastion host is called 
   bastionhost.example.com , you'd create that tunnel with:
   
        ssh -D 127.0.0.1:1080 bastionhost.example.com

4) Build and install the executable with:

   make
   sudo make install
   make clean

5) Try the client:

   sie_get_c             <-- see usage summary
   sie_get_c checkkey    <-- verify key
   sie_get_c channels    <-- get list of channels
   sie_get_c 212         <-- details for a channel

   sie_get_c 212 now 5   <-- grab 5 minutes of ch212
   sie_get_c 212 "2020-01-28 19:17:00" "2020-01-28 19:22:00"
