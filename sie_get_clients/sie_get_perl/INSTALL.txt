1) Put your SIE-Batch API key into ~/.sie-get-key.txt and make sure
   it isn't readable by others:

   chmod u=r,go-rwx ~/.sie-get-key.txt

2) You likely already have perl (in fact, perhaps even multiple copies
   of perl). The script assumes you want /usr/local/bin/perl , but feel
   free to change this to taste. If you want a more-current version of Perl
   than you may otherwise have, if you're on the Mac and using brew, try:

   $ brew install perl

3) Install/update the modules we'll be using from CPAN:

   sudo cpan -i Carp Data::Structure::Util DateTime DateTime::Format::Strptime
   sudo cpan -i File::HomeDir JSON LWP LWP::UserAgent Scalar::Util TimeDate
   sudo cpan -i Time::ParseDate POSIX POSIX::strftime::GNU

4) We assume that the host IP you're using to access SIE Batch has been
   explicitly whitelisted by Farsight.

   IF NOT, you'll need to enable proxy support in the client, then
   create an ssh tunnel to a bastion host that has access

   To enable proxy support in the client, note the line in the perl source:

        my $useproxy = '0';   # '0' is false

   Assuming the bastion host is called bastionhost.example.com :

        ssh -D 127.0.0.1:1080 bastionhost.example.com

5) Install the Perl script to a directory in your path and make it
   executable:

   sudo cp sie_get_pl.pl /usr/local/bin/sie_get_pl
   sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/sie_get_pl

6) Try the client (assuming you have access to ch212; update the specific
   dates to something from the last day or so)

   sie_get_pl             <-- see usage summary
   sie_get_pl checkkey    <-- verify key
   sie_get_pl channels    <-- get list of channels
   sie_get_pl 212         <-- details for a channel

   sie_get_pl 212 now 5   <-- grab 5 minutes of ch212
   sie_get_pl 212 "2020-01-28 19:17:00" "2020-01-28 19:22:00"
