1) Put your SIE-Batch API key into ~/.sie-get-key.txt and make sure
   it isn't readable by others:

   chmod u=r,go-rwx ~/.sie-get-key.txt

2) Install Ruby and any required Ruby gems (what you actually need to
   install will depend on whether you already routinely use Ruby).
   On the Mac, for example:

   brew install ruby
   sudo gem install typhoeus

3) We assume that the host IP you're using to access SIE Batch has been
   explicitly whitelisted by Farsight.

   IF NOT, you'll need to enable proxy support in the client, then
   create an ssh tunnel to a bastion host that has access

   To enable proxy support in the client, note the line in the ruby source:

        useproxy = false

   Assuming the bastion host is called bastionhost.example.com :

        ssh -D 127.0.0.1:1080 bastionhost.example.com

4) Install the Ruby script to a directory in your path and make it
   executable:

   sudo cp sie_get_rb.rb /usr/local/bin/sie_get_rb
   sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/sie_get_rb

5) Try the client:

   sie_get_rb             <-- see usage summary
   sie_get_rb checkkey    <-- verify key
   sie_get_rb channels    <-- get list of channels
   sie_get_rb 212         <-- details for a channel

   sie_get_rb 212 now 5   <-- grab 5 minutes of ch212
   sie_get_rb 212 "2020-01-28 19:17:00" "2020-01-28 19:22:00"
