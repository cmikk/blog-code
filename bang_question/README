INSTALLATION
------------

(1) Unpack the bang_question.tar.gz compressed tar file you've downloaded:

   $ tar xfvz bang_question.tar.gz

(2) cd into the bang_question directory  created by the previous step:

   $ cd bang_question

(3) Install required prerequisite Python3 libraries with pip3:

   $ /usr/local/bin/pip3 install --user .

   Note the trailing space and dot on that command!

(4) Install Chromium:

   $ pyppeteer-install

(5) Make a directory called ~/.bang_question_files

   $ mkdir ~/.bang_question_files

   Note the dot before bang!

(6) Copy exclamationquestion.gif to the ~/.bang_question_files/ directory:

   $ cp exclamationquestion.gif ~/.bang_question_files/

(7) Using wget (or a web browser of your choice) download and save a copy 
of https://whois.arin.net/xsl/website.xsl 

   $ wget "https://whois.arin.net/xsl/website.xsl"

Copy that file to the ~/.bang_question_files/ directory:

    $ cp website.xsl ~/.bang_questions/

(8) (a) Download a recent Routing Information Base file from Oregon Routeviews:

   $ pyasn_util_download.py --latest

That will download a file such as rib.20210104.2200.bz2

(b) Convert that file to the "ipasn_db_file" file we actually need with:

    $ pyasn_util_convert.py --single rib.20210104.2200.bz2 my_ip2asn_db_file

Obviously, substitute the name of the actual RIB file you downloaded for the 
value shown here.

(c) Move my_ip2asn_db_file to ~/.bang_question_files/

   $ mv my_ip2asn_db_file ~/.bang_question_files/

(9) (a) Sign up for a free IP2location account at https://lite.ip2location.com/

(b) Download and unzip a copy of DB9LITEBINIPV6 (note that this is the 
*binary* IPv4 *AND* IPv6 format database, notwithstanding the name!) 
from https://lite.ip2location.com/ 

(c)  Move the downloaded and unzipped file IP2LOCATION-LITE-DB9.IPV6.BIN to 
the ~/.bang_question_files 

     $ mv IP2LOCATION-LITE-DB9.IPV6.BIN ~/.bang_question_files

NOTE: this file may unpack into 
IP2LOCATION-LITE-DB9.IPV6.BIN/IP2LOCATION-LITE-DB9.IPV6.BIN -- you only
want to move the FILE, NOT the file AND the directory by the same name, 
to the new target location!

(10) While in the subdirectory with the bang_question.py file, create 
an alias pointing at bang_question.py:

   $ alias bang_question=`pwd`/bang_question.py

You can then simply say:

   $ bang_question

to run the application. If you just type:

   $ alias

you'll see the alias for bang_question. For example:

   $ alias
   alias bang_question='/Users/joe/bang_question/bang_question.py'

You may want to add the value you see for your bang_question installation 
to your ~/.bash_profile (or similar startup file) to make that alias persistent.
